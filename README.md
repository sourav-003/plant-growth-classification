# 🌱 Plant Growth Data Classification

This project focuses on classifying plant growth conditions based on various environmental and soil-related factors using machine learning techniques. Accurate classification of plant growth helps in precision agriculture, optimizing yield, and early detection of plant stress.

## 📁 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key growth factors
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
- Implementation of various machine learning models such as:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall
- Visualizations for model interpretation

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Features such as temperature, humidity, sunlight, soil type, water content, fertilizer usage, etc.
- Labels that classify plant growth into categories like: Poor, Average, Good

**(Replace with source if applicable)**  
Example: Dataset collected from field experiments or open agricultural datasets.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Results

The final model achieved high classification accuracy and demonstrated strong performance in identifying favorable and unfavorable growth conditions.
